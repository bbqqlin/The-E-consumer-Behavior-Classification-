#Starting point. Okay, now that we have seen the data, let us try to cluster it. Since the initial cluster assignments are random, let us set the seed to ensure reproducibility.

set.seed(20)
irisCluster <- kmeans(iris[, 3:4], 3, nstart = 20)

Since we know that there are 3 species involved, we ask the algorithm to group the data into 3 clusters, and since the starting assignments are random, we specify nstart = 20. This means that R will try 20 different random starting assignments and then select the one with the lowest within cluster variation. We can see the cluster centroids, the clusters that each data point was assigned to, and the within cluster variation.
· Set seed gives the same random start (not sure how to pick that?)
